## Overview

The Newton-Cotes Quadrature or Newton-Cotes Formulae are a type of a broader class of algorithms known as numerical quadrature, which aim to approximate the results of definite integrals [1]. These algorithms are very important for functions $f(x)$ that do not have an antiderivative $F(x)$ which would prevent us from applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus $\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$.
